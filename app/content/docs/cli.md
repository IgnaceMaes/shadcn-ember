## No CLI Yet

shadcn-ember does not have a CLI tool at this time. All components must be installed manually by copying the code into your project.

Follow the [manual installation guide](/docs/installation/manual) to set up shadcn-ember, then copy component code directly from the documentation pages.

We're working on a CLI tool to make component installation easier. Stay tuned for updates!
