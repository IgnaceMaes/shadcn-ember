> [!NOTE]
> **We are not implementing this component.**
>
> The Form component is being deprecated in shadcn/ui. It was originally an abstraction over form validation libraries like `react-hook-form`. Going forward, shadcn/ui recommends using the Field component to build forms instead.
>
> As a result, we are not porting the Form component to Ember. For form validation in Ember, consider using native Ember patterns for validation.
>
> See the shadcn/ui [Form](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/form) documentation for more information about the deprecation.
